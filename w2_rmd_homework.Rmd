```{r}
library(tidyverse)
cleaned_meteorite_data <- read_csv("cleaned_meteorite_data.csv")
```

Q1.2.1 Read the cleaned data into R.

```{r}
cleaned_meteorite_data
```

Q1.2.2 Find the names and years found for the 10 largest meteorites in the data.

```{r}
top_10_meteorite_mass <-
cleaned_meteorite_data %>%
  slice_max(mass_g, n = 10) %>%
  select(name, year_of_discovery)

top_10_meteorite_mass
```

Q1.2.3 Find the average mass of meteorites that were recorded falling, vs. those which were just found.

```{r}
fell_or_found_avg_mass <-
cleaned_meteorite_data %>%
  group_by(fell_or_found) %>%
  summarise(average_mass = mean(mass_g))

fell_or_found_avg_mass
            
```

Q1.2.4 Find the number of meteorites in each year, for every year since 2000.

```{r}
meteorites_by_year <-
cleaned_meteorite_data %>%
  filter(year_of_discovery >= 2000) %>%
  group_by(year_of_discovery) %>%
  summarise(met_per_year = n())

meteorites_by_year

```
